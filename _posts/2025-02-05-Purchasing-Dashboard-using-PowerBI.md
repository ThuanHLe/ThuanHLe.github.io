### Business Question <a name="overview-businessquestion"></a>

Create an overview dashboard for stakeholders that displays the fulfillment rate & COGS (cost of goods sold) of products and helps identify which product or category needs further review.

Develop solutions to improve the situation and optimize costs.

# Discussion <a name="summary"></a>

Overall, the company performed notably well over the year. However, there are a few things our company should escalate in the future:
 * Substitute vendors with Fulfillment rate > 95%.
* Limit sourcing from Mitchell Sports & First Rate Bicycle vendor since Fulfillment rate <75%.
* Needs to pay attention to Helmet Product with a very low Fulfillment rate as well as delivery day (takes longer than 35 days).
* Continue developing strategy for Clothing Category (rapid increase from 2013 to 2014).
* Optimize unit price for each product from vendors that have the same Fulfillment rate & Vendor Rating.
